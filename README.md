# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
Our client Louise run a campaign for play called "Fever". The campaign run from June to July and failed to reach its goal by very low marjin. 

#### Purpose
Gounds to Kickstart project is to analyse the outcomes of all the campain and contributed factors for missing the goal very narrow marjin.
## Analysis and Challenges

#### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
General data indicates that May is the best month to launch the campaigns. From then on the outcomes gradually goes down until September. November through March is the least successful months to start  campaings. <br>

"Fever" campaign started  in June and ended in July. Although the goal was not high the campaing failed possibly due to the start date.

#### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
  General Data indicates that ($1,000-$ 4,999) goal range has 73% success rate and and low fail percentage.Between $ 15,000-$ 20,000 has 50-50 chance of failing or succeding.  As the goal amount raises the percentage of failure raises too. "Fever" had a goal of $ 2,850 and was able to collect $ 2,450.<br>
  
  Although "Fever was very close to the goal it failed to reach the goal. Most likely the timing was the contributin factor for the failure.

#### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
The data shows that timing was not the best for launching campaing despite the decent goal amount. In order to draw sound conculition we needed more data to find out why it failed. For example if there was a pandemic going on or if there was another popular play in town at the same time, , or demographic information of the play location. 

## Results

The counclusions we can draw from this data are:  
   September through March is not a good time to launch to any campaign possibly the spending on Christmas shopping created stress on the spending. <br>
   
   On the ohter hand May is the best time to launch campaign.<br>
   
   Although data indicates 73 % success rate for the bracet of $1000-$4999, "Fever" missed its $ 2800 goal by $400. Well it might have reached if it was in Switzerland or 
   in Singapoure as they are most successful reaching goals on plays.<br>
