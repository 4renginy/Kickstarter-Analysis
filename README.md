# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
The purpose of this project is to find out about Fever campaing and  what is the outcome of data.
### Purpose
Gounds to Kickstart project is to analyse the outcome. Studying  what contributed to the success and what contributed to fail will be instumental for future projects.

## Analysis and Challenges
 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
General data indicates that May is the best month to launch the campaigns. From then on the outcomes gradually goes down until September .November through March is the least successful months to start  campaings. "Fever" campain started  in June and ended in  July. Although the goal was not high the campaing failed possibly due to the start date.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
General Data indicates that Less than $ 1000 goal has the most success and least fail percentage.Between $ 15,000-$ 20,000 has 50-50 chance of failing or succeding.  As the goal amount raises the percentage of failure raises too. Although "Fever was very close to the goal it failed to reach the goal.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
The data shows that timing was not the best for launching campaing despite the decent goal amount. In order to draw sound conculition we needed more data to find out why it failed. For example if there was a pandemic going on or if there was another populr play in town at the same time, , or demographic information of the play location. 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
September through March is not a good time to launch to any campaign possibly the spending on Christmas shopping created stress on the spending.. On the ohter hand May is the best time to launch campaign.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
Although data indicates 73 % success rate for the bracet of $1000-$4999, "Fever" missed its $ 2800 goal by $400,it was very close to make it. Well it might have reached if it was in Switzerland or in Singapoure as they are most successful reaching goals on plays .

- What are some limitations of this dataset?


- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
What kind of activities are more successful in which countries,
